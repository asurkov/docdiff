on GitHub do: each thread a mark where its quote reads in the old text, its card the comment, its replies
and what a push does to its text, with a link to it in the Google Doc; one whose quote no longer reads
there (edited after the comment was made) is listed in the Review panel, On Google Docs. The file's bar
says how many are on text a push changes. With --refresh CMD, ↻ Google Docs runs CMD, an export, in the
