"""Render a repo's uncommitted Markdown changes against a base revision as one inline-diff page.

Usage: docdiff.py [--repo PATH] [--base REV] [--head REV] [--name NAME] [--out DIR] [--new-label TEXT]
                  [--publish CMD] [--reviewed-at REV] [--serve] [--port N] [plugins' options] [paths...]
       docdiff.py --umbrella | --restart | --stop | --install-agent [--port N]

paths are pathspecs relative to the repo root (default: every *.md, and the files plugins make docs of).

Old = the file at REV (default HEAD); new = the file at --head, or without it the working tree,
staged or not, untracked included. Each review is named (--name; by default the repo's name, with --pr
the repo's name and the PR's number) and keeps its page and state in ~/.docdiff/<name>, or in --out, which
~/.docdiff/<name> then links to. One server, the umbrella server, serves every review in ~/.docdiff under
/<name>/ on 127.0.0.1:7878 (--port), with an index of them at /. With --serve, the review is built,
the umbrella server started if it is not running, and "URL: ..." printed. The server stores what the page
sends in the review's dir: accepted/<file>.html, the file as accepted so far, which tells which changes
are still to review; revisit requests in revisit.jsonl. When the head or the base moves, the accepted copy is carried
over by where its changes are, and what changed since the last review is new, with a blue edge (see
accepted_html(), next_round()); --reviewed-at REV makes REV the version last reviewed. It runs docdiff's
code as it is on disk at each request; --restart restarts it (needed only after a change to the server
itself), --stop stops it, and --install-agent prints a LaunchAgent that keeps it running.

The page's header says what is compared (a plugin's title(), or else commits or the uncommitted edits)
and names both sides: a revision with its commit, or the working tree; --new-label TEXT names the new
side instead, for a working tree that stands for something else.

--publish CMD puts "publish accepted" in the header while any file has accepted changes; it publishes
each such file in turn. For each, it writes the accepted copy as Markdown and runs CMD in a shell, {file} replaced by the file's name and {target} by
that Markdown's path; CMD is to publish it and bring the base up to date, after which the accepted copy
starts over from the base. gdocsync's push --target, then its export, is such a command.

Plugins, the modules in plugins/, add their own arguments, docs and buttons (see load_plugins):
respec.py diffs ReSpec specs, gdoc_comments.py shows a Google Doc's comments (--comments), github_pr.py
links changes to a GitHub PR (--pr), review.py keeps review comments and shows revisits' answers.

    add_args(parser): its arguments, which go into .run.json with the rest.
    name(run): None, or the review's name when --name and --out give none (github_pr.py's names the PR);
      run there has the arguments and repo alone.
    counts(run): None, or words for the review's line in the index of reviews, such as '3 comments'.
    PATHS and doc(repo, (base, head), path, memo): pathspecs of the files it makes docs of, beside *.md,
      and the doc a changed file stands for, None for none; memo lasts one listing of the changes.
    htmls(repo, base, head, old, new, out): None for a doc not its own, else as htmls() returns it: both
      sides rendered, and while they are not, (state, html) for the file's section, words for its bar
      and what gets the page to render it.
    section(run, name): None, or (state, html) to add to a file's section: words for its bar, data for
      the page.
    title(run): None where the plugin does not apply, or else (what the page compares, a link or None)
      for the header's first line, in place of "Uncommitted edits" or "Commits".
    top(run): None, or html to put above the docs, such as gdoc_docs.py's list of them; a page with it
      is served even when no doc changed.
    actions(run): None where the plugin does not apply, or else a function (old path, new path, blocks)
      that returns buttons for the popup of a file's changes, {change key: [(label, key, href)]}; the
      button opens href in a new tab, and so does the key on the current change. blocks is the file's
      diff as text, per block [(change key or None, old text, new text)], as block_diff() pairs them.
    place(run, old path, new path, side, before, after): where text of a file's block is in its source,
      for other plugins: github_pr.py's (see there).
    remarks(run, out, refresh): comments made on the docs elsewhere, for other plugins, one source per
      plugin: github_pr.py's reads the PR's on GitHub, gdoc_comments.py's the Google Docs' (see there).
    STYLE, SCRIPT: CSS and JavaScript for the page, after docdiff's own. An element of class panel holds
      off the reload after a rebuild while it shows, and clicks in it leave the doc alone, as they do in
      an element of class ui (a card or side panel), which does not hold off the reload; openRev(g) opens
      the revisit panel on g.quote, g.fields adding to the request it sends and g.context shown above
      it; wordsOf(x), which a plugin may replace, gives the words for accepting change x, W (WORDS for
      the run's mode) by default; onAccept(xs, accepting), which it may replace too, runs before changes
      xs are accepted or taken back.
    get(run, path, query), post(out, path, req): the server's routes. None for a path not its own, else
      (data, content type) with data None for a 404, or the reply to a post, after which the page
      rebuilds, unless the path is in the plugin's IN_PLACE: posts the page shows in place."""
